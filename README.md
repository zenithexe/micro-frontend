# Microfrontend Architecture with Vite Module Federation

This project demonstrates a microfrontend architecture using React and Vite's module federation plugin. It consists of one host application and two remote frontend applications that can be developed, deployed, and updated independently.

## Architecture Overview

- **Host Application** (`host-app`): Main container running on port 5000
- **Remote Application 1** (`remote-app-1`): Standalone app running on port 5001
- **Remote Application 2** (`remote-app-2`): Standalone app running on port 5002
